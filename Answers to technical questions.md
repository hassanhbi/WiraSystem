# Answers to technical questions
## 1. How much time did you spend on this task?
I spent around 3 hours on this task, including coding, testing, and preparing the documentation.

## 2. If you had more time, what improvements or additions would you make?
- Adding more unit tests to cover edge cases.
- Implementing caching to reduce external API calls and improve response time.
- Improving API documentation and structure using Swagger annotations.

## 3. What is the most useful feature recently added to your favorite programming language?
The most useful feature added to C# recently is **records**, which provide a concise way to define immutable data types. Here's an example of how I use them:
```csharp
public record CityWeather(string CityName, double TemperatureCelsius, int Humidity);
```csharp



##4. How do you identify and diagnose a performance issue in a production environment? Have you done this before?

Honestly, I haven't had direct experience diagnosing performance issues in a production environment yet, as I’ve mostly worked on smaller projects or in development environments.  
However, I understand that tools like logs, Application Insights, or monitoring services can help identify where the application slows down or where there's high system load.  
I'm currently learning more about these topics and I'm very interested in gaining real-world experience with them.

## 5. What’s the last technical book you read or technical conference you attended? What did you learn from it?

The last technical book I read was **"Clean Code"** by Robert C. Martin. It helped me improve my coding practices by emphasizing the importance of writing **readable**, **maintainable**, and **well-structured** code.


## 6. What’s your opinion about this technical test?

It was a great experience! It helped me improve my skills, especially in using `HttpClient` more effectively. I learned how to work with APIs and handle data retrieval and processing more efficiently.
